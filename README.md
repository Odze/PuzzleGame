# PuzzleGame

The goal of the project was to learn how to use state machine pattern.

##About Game

Player - Green Dot
Enemy - Red Dot
Exit - Yellow square

The idea is to get Player to the exit without him being eaten by the Enemy (the black circle). For each move that Player makes, the Enemy makes two moves. He always tries to get closer to Player. It  he can move one square horizontally and get closer, he will do that. If he canâ€™t move horizontally, then he will try to move vertically.
